## raTabs origin and features

raTabs was born from the pain that creating a tab component was for the authors.

Why would you need raTabs?

First of all, RatAbs improves your **usability´s** website by allowing your customers to make less clicks in order to change pages. In addition, a tab component allows you to have a more organize interface by creating a structure for all your content and shape a more consistent user experience.

Secondly, having a tab component will allow you to polish your website´s performance because instead of dowloading all the information at once, only the information´s selected page will be downloaded.
